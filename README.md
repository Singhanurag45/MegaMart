MegaMart: Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform
MegaMart is a comprehensive, full-stack e-commerce platform built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It features a responsive, mobile-first user interface crafted with React and Tailwind CSS, offering intuitive navigation through dynamic product catalogs for men, women, and kids. The backend is powered by a robust Node.js and Express.js server that exposes a RESTful API to manage products, user data, and real-time shopping cart logic. Security is a key focus, with a complete end-to-end user authentication system implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management and bcryptjs for secure password hashing. This project demonstrates a complete application workflow, from seamless user interaction on the frontend to complex data management and security on the backend.


‚ú® Features
Frontend & User Experience
Modern & Responsive UI: Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, intuitive, and mobile-first design that looks great on any device.

Fast Client-Side Routing: Seamless navigation between the Home page, category pages (Men, Women, Kids), and product details without full-page reloads, powered by React Router.

Dynamic Product Catalogs: Users can easily browse and filter products directly from the homepage or dedicated category pages.

Detailed Product Views: Each product has its own dedicated page displaying detailed information, images, and pricing.

Interactive Shopping Cart: A fully functional cart where users can add, remove, and update item quantities with the total price updating in real-time.

Backend & API
Robust RESTful API: A well-structured backend API built with Node.js and Express that serves all frontend data needs efficiently.

Secure User Authentication: Complete user authentication system allowing users to sign up and log in securely.

Token-Based Authorization: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure user-specific routes and actions, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their data.

Secure Password Storage: Employs bcryptjs to hash user passwords before storing them in the database, ensuring high security.

Efficient Image Uploads: Handles multipart/form-data for product image uploads and storage using Multer middleware.

Structured Data Modeling: Utilizes Mongoose schemas to enforce a consistent and predictable data structure for users and products in the MongoDB database.
